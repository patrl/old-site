The study of the *syntax-semantics interface*, at a broad level of abstraction, involves the mapping from *syntactic structures* to *meanings*. In principle, these two necessary pieces of the overall picture can be studied independently. Indeed, with regards to *questions*, there is a vast and fruitful body of work on *wh*-movement which pays little heed to how the syntactic structures posited can be mapped to question meanings.

Moving forward, it seems to us that we can achieve even greater insight by considering how meaning informs the grammar, and vice versa. Some representative examples of where such considerations have been crucial include the debate surrounding the locality of covert movement, and island pied-piping; [von Stechow's (1996)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00263537) criticisms of [Nishigauchi (1990)](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780792306436) illustrate the importance of considering how the syntactic structures one posits can be interpreted compositionally. See also [Marta Abrus√°n's (2014)](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199639380.do) work on weak islands, where question semantics play a crucial role in giving a semantic explanation for a phenomenon traditionally within the purview of syntax.

This workshop aims to bring together syntacticians and semanticists working on *questions*-broadly construed, with a focus on the importance of interface considerations.
