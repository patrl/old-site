"The syntax of *yes-no* questions and *yes-no* answers"

> **Abstract:** A *yes-no* question such as 'Is John coming?'' can be paraphrased as 'Tell me which is true: John is coming or John is not coming'. But while the question can be responded to by 'yes' or ‘no’, the paraphrase can’t be. Taking this as a starting point, I will argue that *yes-no* questions all contain a polarity variable which is assigned a value by the answer, positive or negative, 'yes' or 'no'. I will discuss in particular how to account for the syntax of negative *yes-no* questions within this theory.

"Anti-locality revisited"

> **Abstract:** This paper attempts to provide a unified account of a number of restrictions on A-bar movement, bringing them within the remit of a version of antilocality (Grohmann 2000, Abels 2003). In a number of languages, subjects (both transitive and intransitive) necessitate special extraction strategies (so-called *that*-trace effects or que/qui effects – Rizzi 1982, Koopman 1984, Pesetsky & Torrego 2001, amongst many others). Similarly some ergative languages are distinguished by the fact that they show a restriction on the A-bar extraction of transitive subjects (so-called syntactic ergativity - Dixon 1994, Aldridge 2004, 2008, Coon et al. 2015). Recent work has highlighted the similarities between these two phenomena and hinted at a unified account in terms of antilocality (Erlewine 2014). Building on this insight, I consider extraction restrictions on R-extraction in ditransitive contexts. While on the surface, the attested pattern appears to be the mirror image of syntactic ergativity, with R-extraction banned in secundative (accusative) rather than indirective (ergative) languages, a unified account is possible if *v* but not *Appl* is a phase head.
