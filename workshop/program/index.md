"Inversion in embedded questions: new perspectives on the embeddability of illocutionary force"

> <small>**Abstract:** It is well known that certain English dialects permit inversion in embedded questions in restricted circumstances. The syntax of these embedded inverted questions (EIQs) has been examined but reference has not been made to their semantics and pragmatics. By conducting a thorough investigation of syntax and interpretation of EIQs as compared with indirect and direct speech, it is shown that they are part of a unifiable class of quasi-quotational constructions along with Germanic embedded verb second, recomplementation in Romance and embedded imperatives in a range of languages. EIQs will be shown to be particularly useful in driving forward our understanding of quasi-quotational constructions and the extent to which they can be said to encode independent illocutionary force, given the relative ease of determining the role and impact of a question in a discourse as opposed to an assertion.</small>

"Towards a new typology of <i>wh</i>-questions"

> <small>**Abstract:** While the basic premise of Cheng's clausal typing hypothesis (that clauses must be typed) is correct, the predictions that it makes cannot hold. This talk argues that a typology of *wh*-questions cannot be simply reduced to a *wh*-movement vs. *wh*-in-situ or a particle vs. no particle distinction. The talk proceeds to explore what the dimensions of variation are in articulating a more fine grained typology of *wh*-questions.</small>

"On the projection of the uniqueness presupposition of <i>wh</i>-complements"

> <small>**Abstract:** In this talk, I point out that factive and non-factive question-embedding predicates differ in how they project the existential and uniqueness presuppositions of their *wh*-complements, and that this fact is problematic for existing accounts (Dayal 1996, Spector and Egré 2015). I provide an account of this phenomenon by integrating Dayal's (1996) analysis of *wh*-complements with Groenendijk & Stokhof’s (1984) distinction between extensional and intensional question-embedding predicates. I will also discuss a further extension of the analysis that captures the following two generalizations: (i) Spector and Egré's (2015) generalization that a predicate is veridical with respect to interrogative-embedding iff it is veridical with respect to declarative-embedding; (ii) Egré’s (2008) generalization that a predicate is factive only if it embeds interrogative complements.</small>

"The syntax of <i>yes-no</i> questions and <i>yes-no</i> answers"

> <small>**Abstract:** A *yes-no* question such as 'Is John coming?'' can be paraphrased as 'Tell me which is true: John is coming or John is not coming'. But while the question can be responded to by 'yes' or ‘no’, the paraphrase can’t be. Taking this as a starting point, I will argue that *yes-no* questions all contain a polarity variable which is assigned a value by the answer, positive or negative, 'yes' or 'no'. I will discuss in particular how to account for the syntax of negative *yes-no* questions within this theory.</small>
