"Inversion in embedded questions: new perspectives on the embeddability of illocutionary force"

> <small>**Abstract:** It is well known that certain English dialects permit inversion in embedded questions in restricted circumstances. The syntax of these embedded inverted questions (EIQs) has been examined but reference has not been made to their semantics and pragmatics. By conducting a thorough investigation of syntax and interpretation of EIQs as compared with indirect and direct speech, it is shown that they are part of a unifiable class of quasi-quotational constructions along with Germanic embedded verb second, recomplementation in Romance and embedded imperatives in a range of languages. EIQs will be shown to be particularly useful in driving forward our understanding of quasi-quotational constructions and the extent to which they can be said to encode independent illocutionary force, given the relative ease of determining the role and impact of a question in a discourse as opposed to an assertion.</small>

**10:10 - 10:50** -- Jiri Kaspar (University College London)<br>

"Towards a new typology of <i>wh</i>-questions"

> <small>**Abstract:** While the basic premise of Cheng's clausal typing hypothesis (that clauses must be typed) is correct, the predictions that it makes cannot hold. This talk argues that a typology of *wh*-questions cannot be simply reduced to a *wh*-movement vs. *wh*-in-situ or a particle vs. no particle distinction. The talk proceeds to explore what the dimensions of variation are in articulating a more fine grained typology of *wh*-questions.</small>

**11:50 - 12:30** -- Ezekiel Panitz (University College London)<br>

**12:30 - 14:00** -- *Lunch*

**14:00 - 14:40** -- Klaus Abels (University College London)<a name="abelsabs"></a><br>
"On the locality of multiple questions and multiple sluicing"

> <small>**Abstract:** In this talk I will situate the problem of the locality of multiple sluicing within the broader problem of locality of wh-movement generally and, specifically, the interaction of locality and ellipsis. I will argue that reducing the locality of multiple sluicing to the locality of extraposition (Lasnik) is not a sufficiently general solution to the problem of the clause-boundedness of multiple sluicing. Dayal had suggested that there are two paths to the pair-list interpration of a given question: clause-bounded movement and interpretation via a second, less constrained mechanism. This approach is broadly supported by the sluicing facts if we take multiple sluicing to be a way of overtly realizing the clause-bounded mechanism deriving pair list interpretations.</small>

**14:40 - 15:20** -- Wataru Uegaki (Keio / Institute Jean-Nicod / JSPS)<a name="uegakiabs"></a><br>
"On the projection of the uniqueness presupposition of <i>wh</i>-complements"

> <small>**Abstract:** In this talk, I point out that factive and non-factive question-embedding predicates differ in how they project the existential and uniqueness presuppositions of their *wh*-complements, and that this fact is problematic for existing accounts (Dayal 1996, Spector and Egré 2015). I provide an account of this phenomenon by integrating Dayal's (1996) analysis of *wh*-complements with Groenendijk & Stokhof’s (1984) distinction between extensional and intensional question-embedding predicates. I will also discuss a further extension of the analysis that captures the following two generalizations: (i) Spector and Egré's (2015) generalization that a predicate is veridical with respect to interrogative-embedding iff it is veridical with respect to declarative-embedding; (ii) Egré’s (2008) generalization that a predicate is factive only if it embeds interrogative complements.</small>

**15:20 - 15:40** -- *Coffee/Tea*

**15:40 - 16:20** -- Patrick Elliott (University College London)<a name="elliottabs"></a><br>
"Nested *wh-*questions and the locality of scope-taking"

> <small>**Abstract:** In this talk, I argue that nested *wh-*questions broadly support Dayal's (2002) claim that scope-taking is heterogenous for *wh-in-situ*. I observe a surprising asymmetry between Hindi and English nested *wh-*questions: namely, in Hindi a pair-list interpretation is available, whereas in English it is not. I account for this by out-lining a system with two scope-taking mechanisms: (i) covert-movement (with pied-piping), and (ii) existentially-bound choice-functions; for a pair-list interpretation, both *wh*s must take scope via *movement*. The cross-linguistic variation thus can be reduced to the independently-motivated  ability of the inner *wh-*phrase to scramble out of the DP in Hindi.

"Extraction restrictions and asymmetries: towards a unified account"

> <small>**Abstract:** In this talk we consider extraction restrictions in accusative and ergative languages, often referred to as &lsquo;that-trace effects&rsquo; and &lsquo;syntactic ergativity&rsquo; respectively. An interesting (but little-discussed) fact about such restrictions is that they hold either (a) across the board (i.e. in all kinds of A-bar extraction) or (b) only in restricted contexts (e.g. relatives but not questions). Whereas *that*-trace effects hold either (a) only in non-local extraction (English, Nupe, Wolof) or both local/non-local extraction (French, Yoruba), syntactic ergativity holds either in relativisation only (Chukchi) or in all A-bar extractions (Kaqchikel). Using anti-locality as the overriding explanation, we provide an account of this parameterisation based on the composition of the split CP across languages and the particular positions targeted by different kinds of A-bar movement.</small>

**17:00 - 17:10** -- *Coffee/Tea*

**17:10 - 17:50** -- Anders Holmberg (Newcastle University)<a name="holmbergabs"></a><br>
"The syntax of <i>yes-no</i> questions and <i>yes-no</i> answers"

> <small>**Abstract:** A yes-no question such as &ldquo;Is John coming?&rdquo; can be paraphrased as &lsquo;Tell me which is true: John is coming or John is not coming&rsquo;. But while the question can be responded to by &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;, the paraphrase can’t be. Taking this as a starting point, I will argue that yes-no questions all contain a polarity variable which is assigned a value by the answer, positive or negative, &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;. I will discuss in particular how to account for the syntax of negative yes-no questions within this theory.</small>

**17:50 - late** -- *Drinks/Dinner*, Location TBC
