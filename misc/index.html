    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <h3>Linguistics</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz">
      LingBuzz</a> is the one-stop shop for open access papers in generative linguistics. <a href="https://mitcho.com/">Mitcho Erlewine</a> maintains a <a href="https://github.com/mitcho/lingbuzzarchive">public backup</a> as a github repo for those times when the lingbuzz servers are down (which are frequent).
    <li><a href="http://semanticsarchive.net/">Semantics Archive</a> is an open access archive for semantics papers.
    <li>UCL linguistics publish an annual volume of working papers, which can be found <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics/publications">here</a>.
    <li>Norbert Hornstein's blog <a href="http://facultyoflanguage.blogspot.co.uk/"><i>Faculty of Language</i></a> is essential reading for generative linguists.
    <li><a href="http://generativelinguist.blogspot.co.uk/">Gillian Ramchand's blog.</a>
    </ul>
    <h3>LaTeX</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/forest?lang=en">Forest</a> is currently the most full-featured package for drawing syntax trees, and is under active development.
      <li><a href="http://semprag.org/">Semantics and Pragmatics</a> provide an excellent <a href="https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified">BibLaTeX implementation</a> of the <a href="http://celxj.org/downloads/UnifiedStyleSheet.pdf">Unified Stylesheet for Linguistics Journals</a>. This is what I use for bibliographies.
      <li>The built-in beamer themes are (to put it mildly) hideous. <a href="https://github.com/matze/mtheme">Metropolis</a> makes beamer presentations look nice.
      <li>Emacs with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/">AUCTeX</a> is the best LaTeX editor there is. Spacemacs with the <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/latex">LaTeX layer</a> installed provides the same functionality without the hassle.
    </ul>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://tryhaskell.org/">Try Haskell</a> in your browser; If you're a semanticist with some interest in learning to code (like me), then this is worth checking out.
    <li>Along similar lines, <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/"><i>Natural Language Processing with Python</i></a> is a free textbook
      which provides an excellent way for linguists to get into coding with python.
    <li> I recently transitioned from using vanilla emacs, with a custom configuration, to <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/">spacemacs</a>, a beautifully designed modular emacs distribution. Highly recommended for as a general purpose text editor.

    <h2>My setup</h2>
    <p>I'm running <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</a>, <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE's</a> fantastic rolling linux distro. I spend the vast majority of my time in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>. Here's a nice quote from Neal Stephenson (1998; <i>In the Beginning was the Command Line</i>):</p>

<p><q> ...the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer – i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed – emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.</q></p>
