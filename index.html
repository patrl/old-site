    <p>I'm a 2nd year PhD student in the Linguistics Department at University College London funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. My research interests fall broadly within formal syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. I'm a member of the LAGB Student Committee. I also co-run the UCL Linguistics and Philosophy reading group.</p>
