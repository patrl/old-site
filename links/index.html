    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <h3>Linguistics</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Despite its famously unreliable servers, <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz">
      LingBuzz</a> is still the one-stop shop for open access papers in generative linguistics.
    <li><a href="http://semanticsarchive.net/">Semantics Archive</a> is an open access archive
        for semantics papers.
    <li>UCL linguistics publish an annual volume of working papers, which can be found <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics/publications">here</a>.
    <li>I've just started using <a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-jtree">pst-jtree</a>
       for drawing syntax trees in LaTeX. The syntax is a little opaque, but it's incredibly flexible.
    <li>Norbert Hornstein's blog <a href="http://facultyoflanguage.blogspot.co.uk/"><i>Faculty of Language</i></a> is essential reading for generative linguists.
    <li><a href="http://generativelinguist.blogspot.co.uk/">Gillian Ramchand's blog.</a>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://tryhaskell.org/">Try Haskell</a> in your browser; If you're a semanticist with some interest in learning to code (like me), then this is worth checking out.
    <li>Along similar lines, <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/"><i>Natural Language Processing with Python</i></a> is a free textbook
       which provides an excellent way for linguists to get into coding with python.

    <h2>My setup</h2>
    <p>I'm running <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</a>, <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE's</a> fantastic rolling linux distro. I spend the vast majority of my time in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>. Here's a nice quote from Neal Stephenson (1998; <i>In the Beginning was the Command Line</i>):</p>

<p><q> ...the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer – i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed – emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.</q></p>
