#Patrick D Elliott

![This is me.]({{ site.url }}/assets/ParisPic.jpg)

I'm a 2nd year PhD student in the Linguistics Department at University College London
funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. My supervisors are Dr. Klaus Abels and Dr. Yasutada Sudo.
My research interests fall broadly within formal syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
I'm especially interested in how those three things interface. Previously I studied Linguistics
(BA) at University College London and Linguistics (MSc by Research) at the University of Edinburgh.
As of September 2014, i'm a member of the LAGB Student Committee.
I also co-run the UCL Linguistics and Philosophy reading group.
